Code, etc. for paper on XXXXXX. 

+ Phylogeny metrics are in the `goring_metrics.csv` file in /results. 
+ Code used to get these metrics from the `CleanedPresAbs.csv` file is in the `treemetrics.r` file in /R.
+ I parallize the code across cores, but you don't have to, would just take a bit longer.
